# EC8Spectra
Matlab class to generate Eurocode8 spectra. Easy to use, it is based on the definitions provided by *Eurocode 8: Design of structures for earthquake resistance - Part 1 : General rules, seismic actions and rules for buildings*.

As soon as the revised version of the code (EC8) is approved - maybe 2021, a new class will be published alongside these ones.
